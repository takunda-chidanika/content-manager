# Content Manager System/Service

## Overview
This project is a Content Manager System/Service developed using Spring Boot. It utilizes Java version 21 and leverages Docker for managing the database and a Nginx Docker image for rendering files.

## Features
- **Spring Boot** for application development.
- **Java 21** as the programming language.
- **Docker** for containerized database management.
- **Nginx Docker Image** for serving static files.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java 21
- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/content-manager-system.git
    cd content-manager-system
    ```

2. **Build the project:**
    ```bash
    ./mvnw clean install
    ```

3. **Setup and run Docker containers:**
    - Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed and running on your machine.
    - Create a `docker-compose.yml` file to manage the database and Nginx services:
      ```yaml
      version: '3.8'

      services:
        db:
          image: postgres:latest
          container_name: postgres
          environment:
            POSTGRES_USER: user
            POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
            POSTGRES_DB: contentdb
          ports:
            - "5432:5432"
          volumes:
            - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

        nginx:
          image: nginx:latest
          container_name: nginx
          ports:
            - "8080:80"
          volumes:
            - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro
            - ./static:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro

      volumes:
        db-data:
      ```

4. **Run Docker Compose:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

5. **Run the Spring Boot application:**
    ```bash
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run
    ```

6. **Access the application:**
    - The Spring Boot application will run on `http://localhost:8080`.
    - The Nginx server will serve static files on `http://localhost:8080`.

## Configuration
- **Database Configuration:** Update the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file in `src/main/resources` with your database settings:
  ```properties
  spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/contentdb
  spring.datasource.username=user
  spring.datasource.password=password
  spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
  ```

- **Nginx Configuration:** Customize the `nginx.conf` file to configure how Nginx serves your files.

## Usage

1. **Creating Content:**
    - Access the `/create` endpoint to create new content.
  
2. **Managing Content:**
    - Access the `/manage` endpoint to edit or delete existing content.

3. **Viewing Content:**
    - Access the `/view` endpoint to view the content.
