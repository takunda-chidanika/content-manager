Certainly! Below is a sample `README.md` file for your Content Manager System/Service project developed in Spring Boot using Java 21, with Docker for the database and Nginx for rendering files.

```markdown
# Content Manager System/Service

## Overview

This is a Content Manager System/Service developed using Spring Boot and Java 21. The system leverages Docker for database management and Nginx for file rendering. It provides robust content management features to manage and render content efficiently.

## Features

- Content management capabilities including CRUD operations.
- Integration with Docker for seamless database management.
- Nginx for efficient file rendering and serving static content.
- RESTful API for interaction with the content management system.

## Technologies Used

- **Java 21**
- **Spring Boot**
- **Docker**
- **Nginx**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Java 21**: Ensure you have Java 21 installed.
- **Docker**: Install Docker from [here](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
- **Docker Compose**: Install Docker Compose from [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
- **Nginx**: Ensure Nginx is installed on your system.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/content-manager-system.git
    cd content-manager-system
    ```

2. **Build the project:**

    ```sh
    ./mvnw clean install
    ```

3. **Run Docker Compose:**

    Ensure Docker is running, then execute:

    ```sh
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

4. **Start the Spring Boot application:**

    ```sh
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run
    ```

5. **Configure Nginx:**

    Set up Nginx to render files. Typically, you would update your `nginx.conf` with something similar to:

    ```nginx
    server {
        listen 80;
        
        location / {
            proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        }
    }
    ```

### Usage

- **Access the API**: The API can be accessed at `http://localhost:8080/api`.
- **Access the Content**: Content rendered via Nginx can be accessed at `http://localhost`.

### Docker Configuration

The `docker-compose.yml` file includes configurations for the database service. Here is a snippet:

```yaml
version: '3.7'
services:
  db:
    image: postgres:latest
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: contentdb
      POSTGRES_USER: user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

volumes:
  db_data:
```
